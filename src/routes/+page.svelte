            <h2>My Experances</h2>
            <p>
                I first got into coding in 10th grade when I took a cs class. Ever since that class I have always really enjoyed coding, which is becuase i like problem sloving. Code is a subject that requires a lot of creativity and that makes it fun for me. Code can also be a very useful skill, many 
                times I have used my coding knowledge to compliment something I couldnt of without it.
